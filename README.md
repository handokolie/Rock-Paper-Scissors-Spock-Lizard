# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard
## Udacity's Rock Paper Scissors Project
This project is part of the Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree where students are required to write a Python program that plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors between a human player and a computer player. The game is expanded to the Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard version.

The game includes four different computer player strategies and added coloured texts on the command line interface terminal.
